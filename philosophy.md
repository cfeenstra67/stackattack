# Philosophy

**StackAttack - AWS + Pulumi Toolkit**

- These are opinionated resources, based on reasonable defaults for running production software. They will not be suitable for all cases, but they are designed for simplicity, and so the primary method for extending functionality should be either via composition or simply copying & pasting

- Composition over inheritance

- Goal: fully deployed metabase w/ VPN, SSH access, DB, etc. in <100 LOC (<20?)
